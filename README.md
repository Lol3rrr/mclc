# MCL(C)
Minecraft Circuit Language (Compiler)

## Goal
This "Language" and Compiler is meant to help Build Circuits or even Processors for Minecraft to be
builed in Minecraft itself.
For this purpose MCL is designed as a HDL (Hardware Description Language) to describe the Circuit
in a more programming like Language that helps to enforce certain Criteria and also provide an easy
way to encapsulate different Parts of it and quickly refactor

## Feature-Goals
- [x] Basic Design verfication, make sure each Part has correct Number of Inputs etc.
- [ ] Test the Circuits with Test-Cases
- [ ] Synthesis Minecraft "Blueprints" from the HDL
